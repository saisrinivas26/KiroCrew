// The three AWS key-value spellings are KEY-ANCHORED: they begin at the key
// naming the secret. Like the backend's `_credential_value_span`, only the
// `value` group is replaced -- the key and separator stay, so a redacted line
// still says what was redacted -- and a value that IS a redaction tag, byte for
// byte, is left alone (`isRedactionTag`), so this mirror is a fixed point over
// the backend's own output (`key=[REDACTED: credential]`) instead of
// re-collapsing it to `[REDACTED] credential]`. The value group is
// `TAG<class>*|<class>+` (`TAG_ATOM` over `AWS_VALUE_CLASS`): a whole tag plus
// whatever is glued to it, or an ordinary run -- so a bare tag is left alone, a
// tag with bytes glued to its `]` is redacted whole (nothing certified those
// bytes), and a tag followed by a space is a bare tag with an ordinary tail.
// Every other pattern IS the secret and is replaced whole.
const REDACTION_TAGS = ['[REDACTED]', '[REDACTED: credential]', '[REDACTED: encoded credential]']
// Each tag is escaped as a whole regex literal (the backend's `re.escape`), not
// just its brackets: the escape set is the full metacharacter class, backslash
// included, so a future tag carrying `.` or `\` still matches byte for byte.
// The atom is a RUN of one or more whole tags, as the backend's is: two
// credentials that stood side by side inside one value are two adjacent tags,
// read whole, never a tag plus a head cut at the second tag's interior space.
const TAG_ATOM = `(?:${REDACTION_TAGS.map((tag) => tag.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')).join('|')})+`
// The backend's `_AWS_VALUE_CLASS`: a value stops at whitespace, at a quote and
// at a JSON structural delimiter, so a quoted value is replaced INSIDE its
// quotes and the closing quote, comma or brace stays on screen. Held as a RegExp
// and spliced through `.source` for the same i18n-gate reason as `KEYED_VALUE`.
const AWS_VALUE_CLASS = new RegExp(`[^\\s"',}]`)
// A RegExp spliced in through `.source` (byte-identical: the pattern holds no
// `/` and no line terminator, the only bytes the getter escapes), so the i18n
// gate reads this regex source where its `RegExp` callee exemption puts one --
// a pattern, never copy -- rather than as a literal inside an ALL-CAPS constant.
const KEYED_VALUE = new RegExp(
  `(?<value>${TAG_ATOM}${AWS_VALUE_CLASS.source}*|${AWS_VALUE_CLASS.source}+)`,
)
// The backend's `_AWS_LABEL_RULES` label: the key, an optional quote closing a
// JSON key, the separator, and an optional quote OPENING the value. The backend
// keeps all of it and replaces only the value, so its redacted `.env` / shell /
// YAML / JSON pair reaches this mirror as `key="[REDACTED: credential]"`: the
// opening quote has to be the key group's, not the value's, or the tag atom
// never matches and the mirror re-collapses certified-clean text.

  // JWS (3 segments) and compact JWE (5 segments). Post-header segments use `*`,
  // not `+`. A `dir`/`ECDH-ES` JWE has an EMPTY Encrypted Key segment
  // (`header..iv.ciphertext.tag`), so `*` is what makes it redact whole rather
  // than truncating and leaving the ciphertext and tag on screen.
  //
  // Byte-identical to the backend alternative, deliberately, and pinned as such
  // by `test/test_redaction_mirror_parity.py`. No left boundary is used here: a
  // left boundary would stop a two-dot identifier such as
  // `keyJson.parse.value` being redacted, but that trade is
  // the wrong one: the boundary MISSES a real token whenever a renderer
  // concatenates a label straight onto it (`compact=jwt<token>`,
  // `/session/jwe<token>`), which the backend redacts. It also does not prevent
  // the commonest false-positive form, a space-preceded identifier in a stack
  // trace (`at eyJsonSerializer.deserialize.value`), which matches either way.
  // So it would buy two avoided false positives and cost two leaks. A miss is a
  // leak; a false positive is mangled display text.
  //
  // The residual false positive is therefore shared with the backend rather than
  // unique to this mirror, which keeps it ONE defect to fix in one place. Closing
  // it needs a structural test, not a boundary: decode segment one as a JOSE
  // header and require `alg`/`enc`. That belongs in the backend first, with this
  // mirror following, so it is deliberately out of scope here.
  /eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*){2,4}/g,
  // Two-segment dashboard link token (`base64url(payload).base64url(hmac_sig)`).
  // `security.py` carries the full derivation of both bounds and is the single
  // source for it; `test/test_redaction_mirror_parity.py` fails if this copy
  // drifts from it. The local invariant worth knowing here: the signature width
  // is PINNED (`{43}`, a property of the HMAC-SHA256 digest, not of the payload),
  // so a digest change fails a backend test loudly instead of silently disabling
  // redaction, and the payload bound is a generator-derived floor rather than a
  // guess because a guessed floor is beatable by a verbose enough identifier.
  //
  // ONE deliberate difference from the backend: its leading lookbehind boundary
  // is omitted here, and must stay omitted. Safari 16.3 and older cannot compile
  // a lookbehind. `vite.config.ts` declares no `build.target`, so the default
  // `'modules'` floor is `safari14`, and at that target esbuild rewrites the
  // literal into a `new RegExp(...)` call. That moves the failure from parse time
  // to run time, which does not help: this array is a module-level constant in
  // the eagerly loaded entry chunk, so the throw lands during module evaluation
  // and the dashboard renders blank rather than losing one feature. Verified by
  // execution, with `RegExp` patched to reject lookbehind: this shape throws on
  // import, a function-scoped one throws only when called.
  //
  // Removing a LEFT boundary cannot create a MISS, so the divergence is
  // one-directional: verified by execution, no input redacts in the backend and
  // not here. This mirror additionally catches a token a renderer concatenated
  // onto a label (`tok=jwt<token>`), which the backend's boundary makes it miss.
  //
  // The cost is the SAME mechanism, and it is not a benign extra replacement. A
  // lookbehind is zero-width, so the match still starts at an `eyJ`, but that
  // `eyJ` may be one INSIDE a preceding identifier: `keyJson<token>` matches from
  // index 1 and renders `k[REDACTED: credential]`, absorbing the identifier tail.
  // That is the same class of damage cited above as the reason the segment floor
  // was not relaxed to `{1,4}`. It needs an identifier containing `eyJ` glued with
  // no delimiter to 96+ identifier chars, a dot, then exactly 43 more. Not
  // reachable on the surfaces this function feeds: the longest `eyJ`-containing
  // identifier in the tree is 50 chars, the backend already redacts `agent`/`task`
  // before broadcast and truncates `tool` to 80 chars, and the output of this
  // function goes to in-memory store state only. The one surface rewritten before
  // persistence (file-diff chip bodies) is redacted in the BACKEND, so an
  // over-match here cannot reach disk.
  //
  // Ordering after the JWS alternative is defensive, not load-bearing for real
  // tokens: a conventional `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}` header is only 33 chars
  // past `eyJ`, far below this alternative's first-segment floor, so it cannot
  // match a real JWS's `header.payload` at all. It becomes load-bearing only for
  // a JWS whose header clears that floor AND whose payload is exactly 43 chars,
  // because this pattern's right boundary is satisfied by a `.` and would leave
  // `.signature` rendered. That shape is covered by a test.
