"""A runtime death is a PROCESS event, so it is classified once and read by all.

Recovery is written elsewhere as though a dying process were one session's
misfortune. Every tenant of a shared runtime catches its own ``AcpProcessDied``,
independently decides to reset, and independently charges the death to its own
retry budget -- so one process ending produces N resets, N budget charges, and N
unrelated accounts of why. One such death takes every session on the process down
with it -- a measured one carried 15, 8 of them mid-prompt -- and each of those
eight records the loss as its own failure.

This module holds the other half of that story. :func:`announce` is called ONCE,
where the death is detected, and records what the process was carrying at that
instant. Every tenant then reads the SAME record instead of re-deriving one:

* :func:`caused_by_this_session` -- the ONE question a retry budget or a circuit
  breaker has to answer before it charges anybody.

What a tenant is NEVER given is a pid. A session asks about the runtime handle it
already holds, exactly as :func:`kiro_crew.runtime_ownership.outstanding_leases`
answers by object identity, because a session that can name a pid can signal it.

Why the tenants PULL the record rather than being pushed it
-----------------------------------------------------------
A tenant learns of the death the way it already does -- its poisoned session
queue raises into whatever turn it had -- and reads this record while handling it.
No layer is woken on its behalf, because none needs to be: a tenant with no turn
in flight has nothing to recover and re-acquires on its next turn through the
ownership registry, which drops a dead runtime on the way past.

That is also why there is no observer registry here. A notification channel with
no subscriber is a mechanism whose first real consumer would have to redesign it,
so the layer that needs one adds it together with that consumer.

Two independent readings of co-tenancy, and why both are needed
---------------------------------------------------------------
``leases`` is what :mod:`kiro_crew.runtime_ownership` knew: the sessions that
took a lease through the registry. ``acp_sessions`` is how many ACP sessions the
process was actually multiplexing.

They disagree, and the gap is not noise. A sub-agent runs on its parent's runtime
through the parent provider rather than through an acquisition of its own, so it
holds no lease and the registry cannot see it -- while the runtime, which has a
queue per ACP session, can. Reading only the registry would call that process
single-tenant and hand the parent the bill for the child's death, which is the
misattribution this module exists to end. Reading only the runtime would miss a
tenant that has a lease but has not opened its session yet.

The lease reading is not available on every death path, and saying so is part of
the contract. The registry excludes a runtime it considers dead, and it decides
that by asking the runtime's own liveness -- which is already false once the
process has a return code. So on a death that is REAPED (the reader sees EOF and
reads a return code that is already set) the lease count is 0 whatever the
registry holds, and ``acp_sessions`` decides ``shared`` by itself. On a death the
caller INITIATES the death is marked before the process is waited on, so liveness
still holds and the leases are counted. The lease reading therefore closes the
lease-without-a-session gap on the kill path only; on the reaped path that gap is
open, and a tenant holding a lease with no ACP session yet is not seen.

So a process is shared when EITHER reading says so, and neither number is
presented as the tenant count: they are two measurements of one process, and the
honest summary is both.

This module is a LEAF: it imports nothing from ``kiro_crew``. It is reached from
the ACP layer below and from the dashboard, channel and automation layers above,
and an import in the other direction would close a cycle through
``acp.runtime``. The agent-SDK boundary gate refuses such an import outright,
type-only ones included, which is why the runtime is duck-typed here.
