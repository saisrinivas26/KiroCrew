"""Fence-safe markdown splitting, shared by every messaging channel.

Six splitters grew independently — Telegram carries a
``_split_text``/``_split_markdown`` pair, ``messaging/renderer.py`` chunks blind
fixed-width, and Slack, Webex and Weixin have their own — so a fix landed in one
never reached the others. This module is the single engine they converge on, and
Discord is the first channel on it.

Three properties make it safe for the shared path:

**Prefix stability (the streaming contract).** Splitting is greedy
left-to-right and every cut depends only on the text BEFORE it, so re-splitting
a longer prefix of the same stream reproduces every chunk except the last one
byte-for-byte. A streaming caller can therefore send each sealed chunk as it
appears and keep only the final chunk as a live buffer.

**Real fence grammar, not backtick parity.** Counting ``` occurrences misreads
a ``` line inside a ````diff block as a closer and then inverts the open/closed
state for the rest of the message. Here an opener is up to three spaces of
indent plus a run of at least three backticks or tildes, a closer is a run of
the SAME character at least as long with nothing else on the line, and
everything between them is opaque content.

**Self-contained chunks.** A cut inside a fence seals the chunk with a
synthetic closer and reopens the next chunk with the original opener line —
info string and indent included — so ```` ```python ```` survives the split as
```` ```python ````. The FINAL chunk is left open on purpose: callers own final
presentation, and a streaming caller still holds it as a live buffer.

A hard cut is where those properties meet: it splits one line across a chunk
boundary, so both halves start a rendered line and the cut is pulled back until
neither invents a fence. Some fragments admit no such cut — every candidate
lands immediately before indent or a fence character, as in a bare ``` line or
a long backtick run in prose. Those are not cut at all: the line is placed
WHOLE, in a chunk holding it and nothing else, whenever the LINE ITSELF is no
longer than ``limit``. Eligibility deliberately ignores the fence scaffolding
that chunk needs, so the chunk carries its reopener line and synthetic closer on
top of ``limit`` and may pass it by exactly that much; a chunk with no
scaffolding to carry stays within ``limit``. Counting the scaffolding in instead
would refuse a line that fits ``limit`` on its own and cut it into a fence
delimiter its source never contained, which is the worse of the two costs. Only
a line longer than the full ``limit`` cannot be placed that way, and there the
widest prefix-clean cut is taken, so the deferred remainder can still open or
close a fence the source line does not. That residue belongs to the same
degradation regime as a budget too small to hold a line's fence scaffolding:
forward progress and termination come first.

Which of those three a line takes is decided from the line and ``limit`` alone,
before any of the budget arithmetic — remaining room, the reserved closer, what
the chunk already holds — gets a say. So the dirty cut of the third tier is
reachable only through the ``else`` of ``len(line) <= limit``, whatever that
arithmetic works out to. Eligibility written as a guard along one arithmetic
path is what made this ladder bypassable at budgets a fence's scaffolding
consumes whole, and an exhaustive small-space oracle in the tests pins the
property rather than the instances.

Byte-capped platforms wrap the character splitter with
:func:`split_markdown_bytes`, which measures the produced chunks and shrinks the
character budget until they fit. Still out of scope for callers to wrap: pipe
table conversion, rendered-length budgeting for channels that inflate the
source, and UTF-16 length limits.

    Every caller whose transport CAPS what it accepts needs this, and the reason is
    :func:`_cut_where_no_key_rejoins`'s last step: when no budget cuts without
    rejoining a key the splitter declines to cut and answers with the text whole,
    which is fail-closed but is one chunk over the caller's budget. A transport that
    truncates a larger payload would drop the tail of that answer with no notice,
    and the truncation happens AFTER every scan, so nothing sees it.

    Each chunk is bounded and graded ON ITS OWN, and a chunk that repairs is the
    repair's subject, because a chunk is a string this function holds while the
    sequence's concatenation is not the reply -- the seam whitespace is already
    trimmed out of it. The boundaries BETWEEN the chunks handed in are the
    splitter's own, graded where the whole source was still available; the ones
    created here are the new slices inside a chunk, which is exactly what each
    chunk's own grade sees.

    Re-cutting the repair needs no redactor and must not take one: the repair is only
    returned once THIS cutter's pieces of it read clean under every reading the grade
    scans, so the cut taken here is the cut already graded, while a credential-aware
    cut could decline to cut again and leave the budget unmet. ``cut`` defaults to
    the character splitter; a byte-capped transport passes :func:`chunk_utf8_bytes`.

    The budget is applied BEFORE the grade, not after, and that order is the whole
    point. The splitter's fail-closed answer is a list of ONE chunk, and a
    one-element list holds no boundary, so a grade asked about it answers that
    nothing rejoins and the oversized chunk travels on unbounded -- the exact case
    this function exists for. Cutting to the budget first makes the grade see the
    sequence the transport will really deliver, so a key across one of those new
    boundaries is found and repaired. A chunk already inside the budget is returned
    unchanged by its own cutter, so the pass costs nothing.

    ``reserve`` holds back capacity for something the caller appends to every
    chunk (a page counter, a continuation marker). Empty text yields ``[]``;
    text that already fits, a non-positive ``limit``, and a ``reserve`` that
    consumes the whole budget all yield ``[text]`` unchanged.

    Cut preference outside a fence follows Discord's long-standing ladder: a
    paragraph break if one sits at least halfway into the budget, else a line
    break if it sits at least a quarter in, else a hard cut filling the budget.
    The thresholds keep a short leading line from stranding most of the budget.
    Inside a fence only line boundaries are used, and a line is hard-cut only
    when it cannot fit a chunk at all.

    Leading whitespace is never stripped — doing so silently re-indents split
    code. Trailing whitespace is trimmed only when sealing outside a fence,
    where it cannot be content.

    A budget too small to hold a line's own fence scaffolding yields chunks over
    the budget rather than not terminating; callers pass a realistic ``limit``.
    One further chunk may exceed ``limit`` itself, and only by its fence
    scaffolding, when a logical line admits no cut clean on both sides: such a
    line is placed whole whenever the LINE ITSELF fits within ``limit``,
    rather than cut into a fence delimiter its source never contained. Eligibility
    measures the line alone, so the chunk holding it adds the reopener line and
    the synthetic closer on top and may pass ``limit`` by exactly that
    scaffolding; with no scaffolding to carry it stays within ``limit``. Such a
    chunk holds that one line and nothing else. Only a line longer than ``limit``
    is cut without a clean boundary, and there the deferred remainder can still
    read as a delimiter the source line does not. That choice reads the line and
    ``limit`` alone — never the remaining room, the reserved closer, or what the
    chunk already holds — so the cut without a clean boundary is reachable only
    for a line longer than ``limit``.

    ``redactor`` makes the cut itself credential-aware, and a caller that
    delivers each chunk as its own message passes one. The text is redacted
    against the rendered form first, which closes a cut landing mid-line; the
    boundaries are then graded as the reader sees them, and a budget whose
    boundaries are all clean is searched for before anything in the text is given
    up, so ordinary content -- a long wrapped line in a fence, say -- comes back
    exactly as written. The parameter stays optional, because a caller whose
    chunks land inside one message severs nothing a reader can rejoin across
    messages, and the redaction is idempotent, so a caller that already redacted
    its text pays one scan and keeps its bytes.

    :func:`split_markdown_safe` counts characters, which is the right measure
    for most platforms and the wrong one for a platform whose limit is bytes
    (Webex caps a message at 7439 bytes): a chunk of CJK text can sit well under
    a character budget and still be rejected, and a send path that truncates the
    overflow loses the tail silently.

    Measure, don't predict. A budget of ``max_bytes`` characters cannot overflow
    for ASCII, so the first attempt is the common case and costs one pass. When
    a chunk does measure over, the character budget is shrunk by the observed
    overflow ratio and the split is retried — reading the real encoded length
    beats reasoning about worst-case bytes per character, which would divide the
    budget by four and fragment every ASCII answer into quarters.

    A chunk that still does not fit after the ladder is byte-sliced through
    :func:`chunk_utf8_bytes`, and only that chunk: a fence spanning a cut is a
    rendering defect, but a lost tail is data loss, so the byte cap wins when
    the two conflict. This is reachable for input the character splitter itself
    documents as over-budget — a single line longer than the whole budget, or a
    budget too small to hold a line's fence scaffolding.

    ``reserve`` holds back bytes for something the caller appends to every
    chunk, matching :func:`split_markdown_safe`. Empty text yields ``[]``; text
    that already fits, a non-positive *max_bytes*, and a *reserve* consuming the
    whole budget all yield ``[text]`` unchanged.

    A hard cut splits one logical line across a chunk boundary, and BOTH halves
    then start a rendered line the receiver applies the fence grammar to:

    * the prefix ends its own chunk — ``"```abc"`` cut out of ``"```abc`rest"``
      is a valid opener while the whole line is not, and a ``"```"`` cut out of
      longer content closes an open block early, leaving the chunk's own
      synthetic closer to read as a fresh opener;
    * the remainder opens the NEXT chunk — ``"aaaaa```x"`` cut at five emits a
      remainder ``"```x"`` that opens a block the source line never contained
      (its run is mid-line prose), and inside a fence a remainder that is
      nothing but a long enough run closes a block its own line does not.

    So a candidate is accepted only when neither half moves the fence state, and
    the widest such candidate wins. The reference is the state BEFORE the line,
    never the line's own transition: for a line still arriving that transition is
    revocable, so keying the cut on it would move an already-sealed boundary once
    the rest of the line landed.

    The remainder is judged by its FIRST character rather than parsed, and that
    is what keeps prefix stability. A delimiter line must begin with indent or
    the run itself, so any other character rules the remainder out for good,
    whatever arrives after it. Parsing it would instead read text that is still
    growing, where the verdict flips as it grows — ``"```x"`` is an opener until
    a fourth backtick disqualifies it, and ``"``"`` is inert until a third
    backtick completes a run — which would move a cut already sealed one
    character earlier.

    A run of fewer than three backticks or tildes can never be a delimiter, so
    widths 1 and 2 always clear the prefix test, and the fallback therefore lands
    at one or more characters: the caller's forward-progress guarantee survives.
    The caller tells the two answers apart by re-testing the returned width's
    remainder, and reaches for the fallback only for a line too long to place
    whole. *room* is below ``len(frag)``, so the remainder always has a first
