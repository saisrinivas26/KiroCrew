"""In-memory record of the prompt text each turn handed to the agent.

The dashboard's Context Breakdown tab shows what each turn injected by SIZE
(``ctx_blocks``: label -> characters). That answers "how much" but not "what":
a developer chasing a rule the model ignored, a block that doubled, or a marker
that landed in the wrong place needs to read the exact text the turn put on the
wire. The other holders of that text do not serve this reader: the per-turn
diagnostics in ``acp/prompt_blocks.py`` are content-free by requirement, the
usage shards carry sizes only, and the opt-in wire recorder
(``acp/_frame_record.py``) needs an environment variable at gateway start and
writes files a human then has to find.

This module is the small third holder: a bounded ring of the newest prompts per
session, in process memory only, read back through :func:`snapshot` by ``GET
/api/telemetry/prompt-trace``. Three properties fix its shape:

* **Memory, never disk.** A prompt carries the user's memory, lessons and skill
  text. Nothing here is persisted, so a gateway restart forgets it and no file
  needs owner-only permissions, redaction or a review step. The wire recorder
  remains the tool for a durable capture.
* **Bounded in every dimension it retains, and every bound is said.** At most
  :data:`MAX_CHARS_PER_TURN` characters of one prompt (the record says when it
  was cut, and the cut lands on the last whitespace at or below the cap so a
  credential is never split into a prefix the read-side scrub cannot match), at most :data:`MAX_TURNS_PER_SESSION` records per session, at most
  :data:`MAX_TOTAL_CHARS` characters across all sessions, at most
  :data:`MAX_SESSION_KEYS` sessions held at once, and a key longer than
  :data:`MAX_RETAINED_KEY_CHARS` is held under its digest; when the character
  budget or the session count is exceeded the least recently written session is
  dropped whole, and a lone session still over the budget sheds its oldest
  records down to its newest prompt — only a single prompt larger than the
  whole budget may exceed it. A session-start prompt can run to a few hundred kilobytes, a
  busy gateway serves many sessions, and :func:`forget` is called only by the
  dashboard's close and sweep paths (a channel session with no tab open on it
  never calls it), so a ring bounded on text alone would still grow in key
  count and key length for the gateway's lifetime. Each ring counts the prompts its own
  cap pushed out, and a session that was evicted is remembered by key (the same
  :data:`MAX_SESSION_KEYS` bounds that table: two structures bounding one
  population must not drift), so a reader can tell "truncated" and "evicted to
  make room" apart from "never recorded" and "gone with a restart" — a silent
  tail would read exactly like the last two. The one thing cached beside the
  text, a record's block spans, is held only while it costs no more than that
  text (:data:`SPAN_COST_CHARS`), so the whole ring is bounded by twice the
  character budget and a span-dense record is re-scanned per read instead. The
  user-span announcement a record consumes (:func:`announce_user_span`) is held
  outside that budget, on the task, so it retains the user's text only as a
  length and its first and last :data:`USER_PROBE_CHARS` characters — at most
  two probes however large the message.
* **Restricted sessions record nothing.** The callers gate on the session's
  memory mode before calling :func:`record`, the same gate the wire recorder
  and the transcript store apply, so an incognito or temporary session leaves
  no prompt text behind even in memory. Closing or sweeping a tab calls
  :func:`forget` for a ``dashboard:`` session, so a closed session's text is
  not servable either; a channel key is never forgotten there, because the
  channel conversation outlives the tab that showed it.
* **Only sessions a Context tab can show are recorded.** The one reader is the
  slot endpoint, which resolves a tab to ``dashboard:<slot>`` or to the channel
  key a linked tab runs on; a cron, hook or subagent session has neither, so a
  record of its prompt would have no reader and would only spend the shared
  budget — and, under LRU-by-write eviction, push out the idle dashboard
  session a developer is actually reading. :func:`record` therefore skips any
  key outside those namespaces (:func:`readable_session_key`).

The text recorded is the string the provider hands its transport's ``send`` —
after ``EssentialDelivery`` has substituted its receipt envelope, so it is what
``build_prompt_blocks`` wraps into the ``session/prompt`` text block(s). An
image reference in that string becomes an image block on the wire and stays a
path here; that is the one place record and wire differ. The record also keeps
the length the prompt had BEFORE that substitution (``assembled_chars``): that
is the size the assembler measured and the usage row reports, and on a member
session in its acknowledged steady state the envelope is dropped entirely, so
the two lengths differ on every such turn. A reader matching a record to a
usage row compares against ``assembled_chars``; ``chars`` says what went on
the wire.

The user's own text is the one span of a prompt the scan must not trust: a
message with a line starting ``[Memory `` would otherwise read as a memory block
and swallow every genuine block after it. The assembler knows the exact span
and says so with :func:`announce_user_span` right before it hands the prompt to
the provider; :func:`record`, called on the same task once the transport has
accepted the prompt, re-finds that span in the text it is given (the receipt
substitution in between may have shifted it) and keeps it on the record, so the audit view is carved the way the
size breakdown is. A prompt sent with no announcement — a provider driven
outside the dashboard runner — is scanned without a carve, as before.

    """Where *text* is cut to fit :data:`MAX_CHARS_PER_TURN`: its length when it fits,
    else the last whitespace at or below the cap, else ``0``.

    Whitespace is the one delimiter every credential shape the read-side scrub
    knows stops at, so the kept text never ends inside one. The search is NOT
    bounded by a window: a whitespace-free run below the cap is not one token — a
    minified JSON body runs for megabytes without a space and carries quoted
    credentials inside it — so cutting at a fixed offset inside that run would
    keep a credential prefix shorter than any floor the scrub matches, served
    with ``redacted=false``. The run is dropped whole instead, back to the
    whitespace before it, however far that is; with none at all, nothing of the
    text is kept and the record says so (``truncated``, ``chars``).

    One credential shape spans whitespace: a PEM private key, whose body is many
    lines. A key whose BEGIN is kept and whose END fell past the cut is scrubbed
    on read only by the truncated-key fallback, which stops at the first line that
    is not key material — so a block header inside the body ended it early and
    the lines after it were served under ``redacted=true``. The cut therefore
    retreats to the whitespace before the first BEGIN the kept text does not
    close: the key is dropped whole, like every other token, or kept whole with
    its END.

    One linear pass, never a rescan of shrinking prefixes: the markers are walked
    in order the way the scrub pairs them (a BEGIN opens, the next END closes,
    a BEGIN inside an open block is body), so the first BEGIN still open at the
    cut is found in one sweep, and everything before it is closed pairs — a
    prompt packed with thousands of unclosed BEGIN lines costs one scan, not one
    per line (a rescan per line stalled the gateway past its watchdog).
