"""What a cron run must clear before, and while, it dispatches.

The bounded fire-time governance gate and the ``run_never_started`` retention
marker it holds across a cancellation, the screen that keeps a job's ``env`` from
choosing its own governance, the first-run tab pre-create, the claim-time re-vet
inside the cron-pool worker with its handoff against an awaiter that gave up, and
the one-shot post-token CONTINUE resume of an agent turn.

The cron callback that sequences them stays in the facade: the usage-row,
runtime-death and dispatch-site audits count its call sites there.

    The gate runs on its OWN pool, never as a bare ``run_in_executor`` on the

    why the budget is split across those phases rather than given to each -- is
    bounded below the wake deadline ``_execute_with_timeout`` has already armed.
    Both halves of that matter:

    * the shared governance pool is paced by REMOTE senders, so an inbound burst
      would put an unbounded FIFO backlog ahead of a cron gate; and
    * a message job carries no ``_pool_queue_allowance``, so that whole backlog
      would be charged to its execution budget.  With the wake deadline expiring
      first, ``_execute_with_timeout`` catches the ``TimeoutError`` and returns
      normally, so ``_merge_job_result`` sees an ordinary finished run -- and a
      ``delete_after_run`` job is consumed by a run that never dispatched.

    Bounding the wait below the wake budget makes starvation surface as
    ``CronQueueTimeout`` BEFORE the deadline can fire.  That is what makes the

    the event as a policy denial, and pool capacity is neither.

#: governed rather than what it does:
#:

#:   VALIDATED ``approval_mode`` is "auto"; delivered through ``job.env`` instead,
#:   it auto-approves an interactive cron's ``spawn_run`` subagents.
#: * ``KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY`` and ``KIROCREW_ADMISSION_POLICY`` name the FILE

#:   ``platform.governance`` resolves that env path as a tier ABOVE the operator's
#:   own ``security_policy.json`` and the two are mutually exclusive
#:   (first-present-wins), so a job-supplied path replaces the operator's ceiling
#:   for the scheduled agent and every MCP server it starts, rather than
#:   tightening it.
#: * ``KIROCREW_HOME`` picks the same ceiling one level up: ``config.paths`` reads
#:   it to resolve the data home, and ``governance._policy_home_path`` resolves
#:   ``security_policy.json`` under that home, so a job-supplied home points the
#:   ceiling read at a directory the job controls. It reaches the child even
#:   though the policy-path pair would not, because ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is absent
#:   from ``sandbox._AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS`` while the
#:   ``KIROCREW_POLICY_*`` fetch family is in it.
#: * ``KIROCREW_PROFILE`` picks WHICH ceiling is composed at all:
#:   ``platform.resolve_profile`` reads it, and a job-supplied ``standalone``
#:   drops the companion edition's overlay, so an operation the enterprise
#:   ceiling denies resolves as permitted. It is forwarded to first-party app
#:   backends on purpose (``apps/backend.py``), which is the gateway's own value

#: Removing them from every child would therefore drop a real operator ceiling;
#: removing them from ``job.env`` drops only what an app asked for.

    The fire-time gate authorises a run and then the execution is submitted to
    the cron pool, whose queue wait is deliberately NOT charged to the job's
    deadline (that uncharging is this change's sibling and the point of the
    surrounding work).  So the authorisation and the use it authorises are
    separated by a wait bounded only by ``_CRON_QUEUE_WAIT_SECS`` -- and both
    inputs to the decision can change inside it:

    * a script's BODY, because ``run_script_sandboxed``'s launcher re-reads the
      file in the sandboxed child (``open`` + ``compile`` + ``exec``), so the
      bytes that run are whatever is on disk when the worker gets there, not
      the bytes the gate scanned;
    * the governance POLICY, which applies to ``command`` jobs too even though
      a command's text is already captured in ``job.command``.

    Running the vet here closes that window to nil: the queue wait now happens
    BEFORE the decision, and the decision holds at the moment of use.

    This is deliberately an ADDITIONAL vet, not a moved one.  Keeping the
    fire-time gate means a denial is still refused early and cheaply, without
    occupying a cron worker for the queue's duration, and it leaves the gate's
    starvation/retention plumbing (``gate_starved`` ->
    ``run_never_started``) untouched.  The cost is one extra governance
    evaluation per EXECUTED run, plus for a command one extra composition scan of
    its body (length-capped by ``mcp_cron._CRON_MAX_COMMAND_SCAN``) and for a
    script one extra capped body read.
    That work runs inside a worker this job already holds, so unlike gating on
    this pool it puts no policy check behind other jobs' queue -- the property
    the governance-pool split at the call sites protects.  It does count against
    the ``+5s`` backstop the call sites arm, which is why the vet must stay
    short and bounded.

    Consequence for the audit trail, by design: an EXECUTED command/script run
    leaves TWO ``governance_decision`` events per gate (gate time and claim
    time), not one.  They are genuinely distinct decisions -- the second
    is the one that authorised the bytes that ran -- and
    ``vet_job_at_fire_time`` already audits every decision "in its own right so
    the SEL trail shows every permission decision that authorized this
    execution".  A reader counting events per run should expect the pair.

    Because the vet runs BEFORE the payload inside the same budget, the
    caller's deadline can land while the vet is still going -- with the payload
    not yet started.  ``handoff`` is what stops that call dispatching anyway
    once the caller has given up and released its overlap guard; see
    :class:`_ClaimHandoff`.  The check sits immediately before the dispatch and
    nowhere earlier on purpose: the vet itself takes time, so a check made
    before it would be stale by the time it mattered.

    The vet is also BOUNDED here rather than merely asked to "stay short".  The
    caller's backstop carries an allowance for it (:func:`_claim_backstop`), and
    an allowance is only a guarantee if the thing it covers cannot exceed it --
    so a vet that overruns refuses its payload instead of starting one whose
    remaining margin cannot cover the subprocess and its teardown.  Measured

    the INTERRUPTED prompt accumulated — snapshotted before the continuation
    prompt's ``AcpPromptStats.carry_over()`` zeroes the per-turn counter — so
    the caller's usage row can bill both prompts instead of only the
    continuation.

    Eligibility deliberately reuses ``acp_error_is_transient`` — the one
    authoritative classifier — so auth/validation failures and every other
    non-transient error propagate untouched. With NO tokens streamed the error
    also propagates untouched: that window is stream_and_collect's own retry's
    job, and by the time it raises here its budget is spent.

    Inherited tradeoffs, stated for the record (both are the mirrored owner
    decisions from chat_runner/subagent, extended here to the cron surface):

    - A side-effecting tool that was IN FLIGHT (dispatched, no completion)
      when the transient hit may be legitimately re-issued by the continuation
      turn — the CONTINUE instruction forbids re-running *completed* tools
      only. On an ``approval_mode == "auto"`` job that re-issue meets no gate
      and no human, an unattended posture narrower than the live-viewer
      surface the tradeoff is accepted for. Accepted: the window
      is rare (mid-flight tool AND a transient), and failing the whole cycle
      fast is the behaviour the resume exists to remove.
    - The resume adds at most one bounded prompt plus one backoff sleep to the
      cycle's worst case, inside the same per-wake ``asyncio.wait_for``
      deadline. A deadline firing mid-continuation degrades exactly as a
      deadline mid-turn does today (``CancelledError`` is not caught here), so
      no remaining-budget plumbing is added for a one-shot.

    ``parts`` observes chunks across stream_and_collect's internal attempts.
    Its transient retry only fires while no text has streamed, and — a stated
    ASSUMPTION about the provider, not an enforced invariant — a prompt-busy
    error is only raised at prompt submission, before this turn's stream emits
    chunks. Under that assumption the accumulated text never contains chunks
    from an abandoned attempt.
