    """SIGTERM the members a DEAD backend leader left behind in its group.

    The gap this closes: the leader is the only thing the pidfile names, and the
    live-leader branch reaches its whole tree because ``kill_process_tree``
    resolves the group through ``getpgid(pid)``. Once the leader has exited there
    is no pid to resolve the group from -- ``getpgid`` raises -- yet the group
    itself outlives it and its members keep the app's PORT bound. Dropping the
    row there leaks exactly the orphan that makes the next generation's spawn
    collide and serve 502s.

    The group number is recoverable from the contract rather than from the dead
    pid: a backend is spawned with ``start_new_session=True``, so its pgid IS its
    leader's pid. What is NOT safe is signalling that number -- the kernel may
    have reissued it to an unrelated session leader, and ``killpg`` would take a
    stranger's tree. So this hands the number to
    :func:`session_pid.signal_orphaned_spawn_group`, which lists the group's live
    members, keeps only those whose ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` carries THIS spawn's
    instance token, and signals each of them pinned to its own pid + start
    instant. No vouching member means no signal.

    Returns ``(vouched, signalled, keep_row)``.

    *vouched* is every live member this census FOUND, and it answers exactly one
    question: is there a group here worth escalating at all. It is NOT the basis for
    retention -- it is a snapshot taken BEFORE the SIGTERM, so it cannot contain a
    member the SIGTERM itself caused to be forked, and the caller re-reads the group
    at decision time instead. *signalled* is the subset a signal actually reached,
    and is ONLY the escalation's target set: a member that never took a SIGTERM owes
    no grace and no SIGKILL. Keeping the two apart is the whole point -- a signal can
    fail on one member and land on another (``pidfd_open`` answering EMFILE, or
    EPERM), so the signalled set is an INCOMPLETE census and anything that treats it
    as the membership will call a group gone while a live member holds the port.

    *keep_row* is consulted only when *vouched* is empty, and answers whether the
    pidfile row -- this orphan's only handle -- should survive a start that took no
    census at all: a scan that raised tells us nothing, so the row stays for a later
    attempt, while the two declines detected BEFORE any signal (no instance token,
    a host that cannot read the vouch) are permanent on this host and drop it
    rather than growing the pidfile forever. When *vouched* is non-empty the caller
    decides retention from that census's liveness instead. Never raises: a failed
    reap must not abort the rest of the startup sweep.
