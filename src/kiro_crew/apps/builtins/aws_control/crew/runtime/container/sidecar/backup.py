"""One backup cycle: what must be durable, and how each object is copied.

## What is in the set

Three kinds, and the set is a definition rather than a filter, so "was this file
backed up" has an answer that does not depend on what the directory happened to
hold:

1. **The two authority files**, ``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json``. They
   turn a slot id back into a conversation, so without them the transcripts are on
   disk and the conversation list is empty.
2. **Every live transcript**, the ``.jsonl`` files directly under the sessions
   directory. One per conversation this task has served.
3. **Every archived segment** under ``sessions/archive/``. Rotation moves the older
   part of a long conversation there and the container never reads it back -- the
   front's fetch may not list, and finding a segment requires listing -- so these are
   uploaded for the owner's control plane, which has credentials of its own. Leaving
   them behind would be silent loss of the older half of every long conversation.

Anything else under the sessions directory is not in the set. The front writes a
temporary file there while fetching and unlinks it itself, and a name that is
neither that nor a transcript is not a conversation.

## What order they go in, and why the order is a correctness rule

The transcripts go first and the authority files last, in their own phase. The
authority files are the INDEX: a replacement reads them to decide which conversations
exist, and the front then fetches each named transcript lazily. So an authority table
newer than the transcripts it names points at objects that are not in the bucket, and
the front reads an absent transcript as a conversation with no history -- a live
conversation served empty, with nothing raised anywhere. The opposite skew is
harmless: an authority table older than the transcripts names only slots whose bytes
are already there, and a transcript it does not name yet is unreferenced rather than
misread.

Which is why the authority files are OPENED first, before a single transcript is
listed, and sent from those descriptors at the end. Opening fixes the instant a file
describes, so the pair is one coherent snapshot of the index taken before the
enumeration it indexes. Reading them at send time instead let a slot table flushed
during the cycle name a transcript that cycle never listed.

That rests on the backend publishing both files the way it publishes a transcript, a
temporary file and a rename, which leaves an open descriptor addressing the whole
previous version. It does: ``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json`` are both written
through an atomic replace. A writer that truncated one in place instead would take the
snapshot property away without changing anything here, so it is pinned by a test rather
than left as an assumption.

The authority phase is SKIPPED when the transcript phase suffered a refusal a LATER
CYCLE COULD GET PAST -- a failed upload, an object the drain window could not fit, a
directory missing right now. Publishing it then would advance the index past bytes this
cycle failed to write; withholding it leaves the pair at the last cycle that completed,
which is older and coherent, and the next cycle publishes a pair the bucket supports.

It is NOT skipped for a refusal decided by an entry's SHAPE -- a symlink or a FIFO where
a transcript belongs, a linked archive root. Withholding is a WAIT, and every later cycle
meets that entry too, so the wait never ends: the index would freeze at the moment the
entry appeared while transcripts kept uploading past it, and the next replacement would
restore a conversation list predating every conversation served since. The cycle is still
incomplete and the entry is still named; see :class:`RefusedEntry` for the split and for
the bounded residue it accepts in exchange.

One residual remains in the pair itself. The two files are two PUTs, so a failure
between them leaves the bucket holding one from this cycle's snapshot and one from an
earlier cycle's. Both were opened before this cycle's enumeration, so neither names a
transcript that is absent, and the failure raises rather than passing quietly; the cost
is one interval in which the two files disagree about which slots exist, which the next
cycle resolves.

## How one object is copied

``open_snapshot`` opens the file ONCE and records the length that descriptor's file
had at that moment. The upload then sends exactly that many bytes from that
descriptor. Three properties follow, and they are the three constraints this design
has to hold at the same time:

* **Consistent** without a lock. The backend publishes a transcript with a temporary
  file and a rename, so it never writes into the bytes behind an open descriptor --
  it swaps the directory entry to a different inode. A descriptor opened before the
  swap keeps addressing a whole, finished version, and a file that is appended to
  instead is uploaded as the prefix that existed at open time, which is also a
  version that was really on disk.
* **Bounded** on disk. Nothing is copied first. A cycle spends one descriptor and one
  fixed transport buffer per object, so an oversized artifact cannot fill the
  filesystem the app is writing to.
* **Nothing dropped.** There is no size at which an object is skipped. An entry that
  genuinely cannot be uploaded is recorded and the cycle ends by RAISING
  :class:`BackupIncomplete` -- after uploading everything it could, so one bad entry
  does not cost every other conversation its backup.

## Every shape an entry can have, and what happens to it

## What the fingerprint is for, and what it is not

Change detection is a COST decision, not a correctness one. The fingerprint is the
inode, the length and the modification time as they were at open, and an object is
re-uploaded whenever it differs from the one last uploaded successfully. It lives in
memory, so a restarted sidecar re-uploads everything once: paying for a full cycle is
the right way to be wrong here, and persisting the state would put a second authority
on disk to keep in agreement with the bucket.

    The incarnation orders tasks for the commit fence, and that ordering must NOT come from a
    host wall clock -- cross-host skew would let a replacement on a slower clock mint an older
    token and be refused as superseded forever, and one future-dated commit would poison the
    pointer for every later task. So the ordering is derived from SHARED STORAGE: read the
    committed pointer once at startup and mint the NEXT incarnation after the one it carries
    (:func:`keys.next_incarnation`), so this task's commits sort strictly after the committed
    generation's, independent of any clock. A missing or legacy pointer (``None``) carries no
    incarnation to follow, so this task starts at the base counter -- the same tolerance the
    restore applies, and the pointer's own compare-and-swap still settles a genuine race.

    An UNUSABLE pointer is NOT treated that way, and is NOT swallowed into a base token. A
    base token minted from an unreadable pointer is strictly LESS than whatever a predecessor
    actually committed, so :func:`_commit_generation`'s fence would then refuse every commit
    this task ever attempts -- for the task's whole life, with no in-process recovery -- while
    its blobs upload unreferenced and the replacement boots the predecessor's generation
    holding none of the turns this task served. A single transient GET (a throttle, a 503, a
    reset) is enough to reach here, because the sidecar's own read is ``BACKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS``
    = 1 and a throttle is not a permanent code. So :class:`generation.PointerUnusable`
    propagates: the writer refuses to START on it -- the same posture ``restore_authority``
    already takes and the same posture this process takes for :class:`StoreUnusable` -- so the
    fault is reported loudly at boot rather than minting a token that silently fences the task
    forever. The read is retried once at the base attempt count; a transient answer that
    clears on the next task boot is exactly what the restart recovers.

    When the supervisor already CLAIMED ownership before restoration (:func:`generation.
    claim_ownership`), it exports the claimed token in :data:`generation.ENV_CLAIMED_INCARNATION`
    and this ADOPTS it rather than reading the pointer and bumping again. Re-deriving here would
    bump a SECOND time, leaving the committed pointer (which the supervisor set to the claimed
    token) naming a token no live task holds, so the writer's own first commit would be fenced

    until someone removes the name. A transient refusal is the ordinary case and the
    opposite: a directory missing right now, a descriptor that could not be opened, with

    The cycle needs the difference because WITHHOLDING THE AUTHORITY PAIR IS A WAIT. It

    The two lists are separate because the authority files are POINTERS: they name the
    transcripts, so they are only true once those transcripts are in the bucket. Holding
    them in their own phase is what lets the cycle publish them last, and withhold them
    entirely when a transcript did not make it.

    The refusals belong here rather than being discovered later because some of them are
    decided while LISTING, not while opening: a linked archive directory means a whole
    subtree is not enumerated, and that has to reach the cycle as a refusal. A set that
    returned only items would report a short cycle as a complete one.

    ``refused`` and ``unreachable`` carry the LIVE and AUTHORITY refusals, complete when the
    set is built. The ARCHIVE refusals live on ``archive_sink`` instead, because the archive
    is streamed: its walk runs as ``data`` is consumed, so its refusals are known only once
    that stream is drained. :func:`run_cycle` reads the sink after the upload phase and
    before its withhold check, folding the archive refusals into the same split. Both are
    split exactly as :class:`RefusedEntry` splits them: the cycle withholds the authority
    pair for a refusal a later cycle can get past, and must not for one it cannot, because
    that withholding would never end.

    ``data`` is a lazy iterable rather than a built list: it lists the live transcripts (one
    flat directory, bounded) and STREAMS the archive tree one path at a time, so the upload
    phase's deadline gate is reached with the archive inventory never held in a list at any
    level and stops the cycle mid-stream instead of after the whole inventory is in memory.
    It is re-iterable -- each iteration re-lists the live paths and re-walks the archive
    afresh, resetting ``archive_sink`` -- so a caller that reads it more than once is safe.

    asked for. A cycle that could not commit one transcript leaves the authority files

    A failure between the two authority PUTs leaves the bucket holding one file from this

    direction -- both were opened before this cycle's enumeration, so neither names a
    transcript that is not in the bucket -- and it is not silent: the failure is a refusal,
    the cycle raises on it, and the next cycle publishes the pair together. What it costs
    is one interval in which the two files disagree about which slots exist.

    *deadline* is a ``time.monotonic`` reading after which no further object is attempted.
    The final cycle passes one, because it runs inside a drain window and uploads
    sequentially: without a bound the window elapses mid-PUT and the process is SIGKILLed,
    which loses the object in flight and says nothing about the ones behind it. With one,
    every object the cycle could not reach is recorded as a refusal by name, the cycle is

    :func:`_merge_transcript_index` carries nothing forward and the merged index names only
    the stems THIS cycle enumerated on local disk. A legacy bucket's conversations have their

    ONLY while there is no pointer; the moment this cycle publishes the first pointer, an
    unindexed stem resolves to ABSENT and the conversation is served empty history -- the
    legacy transcript silently discarded on protocol adoption.

    So for every stem the CAPTURED authority pair names that the merged index does not already
    cover, the legacy object is read and PROMOTED into the content-addressed protocol: its

    Last is the property the restore depends on, not a preference. A cycle interrupted
    anywhere in the authority phase therefore leaves the pointer naming the PREVIOUS
    generation, whose objects are all still there and were never rewritten -- so the
    replacement boots from a coherent older pair instead of a torn newer one. Committing
    first would invert that: the pointer would name a generation the crash never finished
    writing, and the restore would refuse a bucket whose previous generation was fine.

    The commit is fenced two ways, and both are required. The pointer PUT is a COMPARE-AND-
    SWAP on the ETag this cycle read, which rejects a commit whose read went stale. On top of
    that the pointer carries this task's INCARNATION token, and the commit refuses to publish
    when the committed pointer's incarnation is NEWER than this one's. The CAS alone cannot
    catch the overlap the two fences together close: a predecessor task whose cycle BEGAN
    AFTER its replacement committed reads the replacement's pointer, so it holds a FRESH ETag
    and its ``If-Match`` would succeed -- rolling the committed generation back to the
    predecessor's older, local-only state. The incarnation is minted once per task at process
    start and is strictly greater for a later-started task, so a predecessor whose incarnation
    is older than what is committed is refused: a superseded task cannot publish.

    Skipped, not failed, when the pair was not whole or anything in this cycle was
    refused: a generation is committed only when it contains one.

    Sent once per published generation through the same *state* map the objects use, so an
    idle cycle that re-published nothing does not re-PUT the pointer. The fingerprint is
    derived from the pointer's own bytes, because it is the one object with no file behind
    it, and it is written only after the PUT returns, so a failed commit is retried.

    A pointer that cannot be written is recorded in ``withheld`` on an interval cycle, and
    that cycle stays complete: the previous generation is still committed and still whole,
    so nothing is lost -- this cycle's newer pair simply is not adopted yet, and the next
    cycle commits it.

    On the FINAL cycle the same failure is a refusal instead, because the recovery above
    is a later cycle and the final cycle has none. Left withheld it would exit zero and
    report a lossless stop while the replacement adopts the generation the pointer still
    names -- the older index, without the conversations this cycle wrote. ``deadline`` is
    what tells the two apart: only the final cycle sets one.

    rotation nests it and retention-off never prunes it, so without a bound one entry per
    archived segment -- and each entry's KEY STRING, an unbounded-length identifier -- would
    grow the map for the process's whole life, the very unbounded retention the streamed
    enumeration was built to stop, reappearing in *state*.

    *is_archive* is supplied by the CALLER, because under content-addressing a key does not
    carry where its bytes came from: both a live transcript and an archived segment are
    ``data/blob/<digest>``, so the key cannot be read to tell them apart. The upload phase
    knows -- an archived segment is the pair whose stem is ``None`` -- and says so here. A
    prefix check against the archive directory cannot work, because a content-addressed key
    carries the digest of the bytes, not the directory they came from.

    The cap is enforced HERE, as each archive key is inserted, not once at the end of a
    cycle. A single cycle can enumerate an arbitrarily large archive, so a post-cycle sweep
    would let the map hold that whole cycle's archive keys transiently before trimming them

    :data:`_ARCHIVE_STATE_CAP` at EVERY moment, so neither the count nor the retained key
    identity ever runs past it, mid-cycle or after.

    The archive-key ORDER is tracked in a companion FIFO on :class:`DurableState` so the
    oldest is found and the population sized in O(1), not by rescanning the whole map on
    every insertion. The FIFO is also the ONLY record of which keys are archive, now that
    the FIFO is the sole record of which keys are archive, because the content-addressed key
    shape does not say: a key goes in the FIFO exactly when a caller inserts it with

    Returns the ``stem -> blob-digest`` map for the LIVE transcripts this phase reached --
    the transcript index the committing cycle publishes so the front, reading it, can fetch
    a slot's blob by content without a listing. An archived segment is uploaded as a blob
    too (durability) but earns no index entry: the front never fetches one.

    Each data object is CONTENT-ADDRESSED: its bytes are digested and it is written at
    ``data/blob/<digest>`` with ``If-None-Match: *``, so two writers overlapping in the
    task-replacement window never contend for one mutable key -- differing bytes take
    different keys and identical bytes converge on one, a re-PUT of which the store answers
    with a defeated precondition that is success, not a fault. This is what closes the stale
    -overwrite hazard the old mutable ``data/sessions/<stem>`` key carried.

    Stops attempting objects once there is not enough of *deadline* left for one PUT's
    whole retry budget, and records every object from there on as refused BY NAME. Trying
    one more and being killed in the middle of it would lose that object and leave the rest
    unmentioned; stopping first costs the same objects and says which they are.

    *committed_index* is the transcript index of the currently committed generation, read
    once by the caller. It is what settles the durability of a transcript that VANISHED
    before this phase could open it: a gone stem is still durable when the committed index
    names a digest for it and that blob is recorded durable, and undurable otherwise.

    *yield_when* lets an ordinary interval cycle stand down the moment a stop arrives. Its
    uploads predate the backend's flush, so everything it has left is something the FINAL
    cycle will send anyway -- continuing only spends the drain window that cycle needs.

    does not pass it: those keys live under the cycle's own fresh generation id, so nothing
    is there to collide with, and the pointer's own compare-and-swap is the fence that
    settles concurrent commits.

    *budget* is the seconds the caller's deadline gate set aside for this object, handed to
    the store so the PUT is bounded by the same number the gate reserved. Without it the
    gate reserves a window the transmission is free to overrun, which is the one way an
    object is lost rather than reported: the drain SIGKILLs the process in the middle of a
    PUT, so that object and every object after it go with no record of which.

    *cancel* is what an interval cycle hands over instead. It has no window to reserve, so
    it has no budget to pass; the predicate is how its upload is still ended the moment the
    stop arrives, rather than after a transmission that has no bound at all. Neither is a
    permanent failure, so a cut upload is recorded as this cycle's refusal and re-attempted.
