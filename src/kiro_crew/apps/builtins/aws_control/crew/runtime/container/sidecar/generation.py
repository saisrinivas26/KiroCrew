"""The committed-generation pointer, read the same way by both processes.

Each cycle publishes its two authority files as a PAIR into a WRITER-UNIQUE generation --
``gen/<id>/session_map.json`` and ``gen/<id>/open_slots.json``, where ``<id>`` is minted
fresh by :func:`keys.new_generation_id` and never rewritten. A single object -- the
pointer -- names the generation id whose pair is committed, and the commit is a
compare-and-swap on that one object. Three consequences follow, and they are the whole
reason the protocol has this shape:

* Two writers racing in the task-replacement window each mint a DISTINCT id and write a
  distinct generation, so neither overwrites the other's pair and no committed pair is a
  cross-writer tear. The compare-and-swap on the pointer settles which one generation is
  the committed one.
* A cycle interrupted between the pair's two PUTs damages only its own generation, which
  no pointer references. The pointer still names the previous generation, whose objects
  are immutable and were never rewritten, so a replacement boots from a coherent older
  pair rather than a torn newer one.
* Commitment is a single object, and a single object is either there or it is not. There
  is no state in which half a commitment is visible.

The pointer's ABSENCE is meaningful rather than an error. A bucket written before this
protocol holds the authority objects at their ``data/`` keys with no pointer, and that is
read as GENERATION 0. Those objects are never deleted, moved or rewritten, so a bucket
does not have to be migrated to be read, and a writer that predates the protocol keeps
producing buckets this one understands.

The interpretation lives here and neither process keeps its own copy, for the reason
``keys.py`` gives for key derivation: the writer and the reader agreeing with each other
while both disagree with the contract is the failure this shape makes unrepresentable.

    a slot, and the successor then captures its now-stale pair and commits it under a newer
    incarnation, deleting the predecessor's slot from committed history. The commit fence only
    refuses the predecessor AFTER the successor has committed, which is too late.

    So the successor claims ownership FIRST, at the moment of this call -- before restoration
    -- by bumping the committed pointer's incarnation IN PLACE: the generation id and the
    authority list are preserved (this is not a new commit, it names the same generation), and
    only the incarnation advances to :func:`keys.next_incarnation` of what was committed. The
    bump is a COMPARE-AND-SWAP on the pointer's ETag, so two successors racing to claim settle

    committed incarnation is strictly greater than any predecessor's, so a predecessor's later
    commit is refused by :func:`keys.incarnation_supersedes` -- the fence now bites from BEFORE
    restoration rather than after the successor's first commit.

    The returned token is this task's incarnation, which the sidecar MUST adopt (rather than
    re-deriving its own, which would bump a second time and leave the committed pointer naming
    a token no live task holds). The successor's own commits carry exactly this token, so when

    backend never reaches readiness aborts without ever committing anything, and the bumped
    incarnation it leaves behind outlives it: a still-healthy predecessor's every later commit
    is then refused as superseded by :func:`keys.incarnation_supersedes`, and the turns it
    serves are silently never durable. A failed replacement must not permanently fence a live
    predecessor, so the abort path releases the claim here.

    The release restores the EXACT pre-claim pointer bytes the claim captured, under an
    ``If-Match`` on the ETag the claim's own write produced -- so it is a compare-and-swap
    against the pointer the claim left, not a blind write:

    * If the committed pointer is STILL the one this claim wrote, the CAS matches and the
      predecessor's own incarnation is committed again verbatim; the fence stops superseding
      it. Restoring the exact prior token (not merely a lower counter) is what
      keeps the equal-counter tie-break from fencing the predecessor by identity.
    * If another successor has since claimed on top of this one, the ETag does not match,
      the CAS fails, and the release is a NO-OP -- reverting would clobber that newer, live
      claim and un-fence this aborting task against it. The newer successor's own abort path
      (or its first commit) owns the pointer now, so leaving it is correct.

    """The committed generation's ``stem -> blob-digest`` map. Never treats absence as empty.

    Called only with a COMMITTED generation id, and every committing cycle writes this index
    object before it commits the pointer -- an EMPTY index when the generation has no live
    transcript, never no object at all. So an object that is ABSENT here is one that external
    retention DELETED while the committed pointer still references it, not a generation that
    legitimately published none. Treating that absence as ``{}`` would read every stem as a
    fresh conversation and the next cycle would overwrite the real history with no recovery
    -- so :class:`ObjectAbsent` is refused as :class:`TranscriptIndexUnusable` rather than
    returning empty. A generation-0 bucket (no committed pointer) never reaches here: the
    caller resolves that before asking for an index.

    Raises :class:`TranscriptIndexUnusable` when the object is present and will not parse,
    or maps a stem to something that is not a well-formed blob digest -- because a value that
    is not a digest cannot be turned into a blob key, and guessing past it would send the
    front to the wrong object. A read that fails for a transport reason is unusable too; a
    denial is never read as absence, for the reason the pointer read gives.

    The values are validated to be blob digests HERE so the front, which turns them into
    keys, cannot be handed a value that carries a path -- the same containment the pointer's
    generation-id check provides.

    *deadline* bounds the GET on the final cycle, for the same reason the pointer read is
    bounded: this index can be multi-megabyte and its read runs inside the drain window, so a
    trickling connection the socket timeout never trips is cut as a verdict rather than
    SIGKILLed before the final commit.
