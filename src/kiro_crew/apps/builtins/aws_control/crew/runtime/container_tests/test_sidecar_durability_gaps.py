"""The four ways the first version of this pair claimed durability it did not have.

Each test here exists because a review found a path where the writer reported success,
or kept reporting progress, while a task replacement would still have lost the
conversation. They are grouped in one file because they are one theme: the difference
between "the backup ran" and "the bytes are in the bucket".

1. **The shutdown cycle has to BEGIN after the stop.** The supervisor signals this
   process only after the backend has flushed, so a cycle already running when the
   signal lands cannot contain that flush. Accepting it as the final one loses exactly
   the turns the final cycle exists to save.
2. **A failure no retry resolves has to end the process.** A denied ``PutObject`` is
   not a slow bucket. Retrying it at the next interval forever fills the log while the
   task keeps taking turns nothing will ever save.
3. **A missing bucket is not an absent object.** Read as absence, it reports both
   authority files missing, and the backend boots with an empty slot table and flushes
   it over the real one.
4. **A symlink above a file is as dangerous as a symlink at it.** ``O_NOFOLLOW`` guards
   the last name only, so a plain descent follows a link planted at the archive
   directory -- which the agent writes in -- and uploads every file behind it.
5. **The index must not name bytes that are not there.** The authority files say which
   conversations exist and the front fetches each named transcript lazily, so an
   authority table uploaded ahead of its transcripts sends the front to an absent
   object, which it reads as a conversation that never had history.
6. **The index is a snapshot, not a read.** Opening the authority files fixes the
   instant they describe. Read at send time instead, a slot the backend flushed
   mid-cycle names a transcript that cycle never enumerated.
7. **A body the transport cannot rewind is not a body it can send.** The transport seeks
   the body back before it signs or resends; a body that refuses turns a transient error
   into a lost object, and one that can seek PAST its snapshot sends bytes the cycle never
   measured.
8. **The final cycle needs a bound, not just a window.** It uploads sequentially and
   nothing bounds how many objects changed, so the drain window can elapse mid-upload.
   A deadline turns that from a kill into a short cycle that names what it missed.
9. **The index needs its own room inside that bound.** A data phase allowed to spend
   the whole deadline leaves the authority pair none, and those PUTs are then killed
   mid-request -- publishing one file and not the other.
10. **Publication links an inode, not a name.** Closing the temporary before linking it
    publishes whatever its pathname points at by then, and these are directories the
    agent writes in.
11. **A bound the transport does not honour is not a bound.** The gate admits an upload by
    reserving what one PUT may cost, so that number has to be derived from what the client
    is configured to spend -- every attempt's connect AND read, plus the waits between
    attempts. Reserved short, the gate admits an object the drain window cannot finish and
    the kill lands mid-PUT, which is the outcome the deadline exists to replace.
12. **Deriving the number is not enforcing it.** A socket timeout bounds one read, not a
    request: a connection handing over small chunks inside that timeout never trips it, so
    a large object's send time is unbounded no matter how the reservation was computed. The
    window the gate reserves has to be handed to the transmission and stop it, or the gate
    is reserving time the PUT is free to overrun -- back to a kill mid-PUT, with this object
    and every object behind it lost and unnamed.
