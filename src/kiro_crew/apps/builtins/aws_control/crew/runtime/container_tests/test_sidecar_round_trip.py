"""One customer's conversation, carried across a task replacement.

The two halves of durability run in different processes and meet only at the object
key, so each half passing its own tests proves nothing about the pair: a writer and a
reader can agree with each other while both disagree with the contract. These tests
drive the pair as one path.

The replacement is simulated the way the platform performs one. The first task's data
home is abandoned whole, and a SECOND ``Settings`` is built over an empty directory
with the same crew name and prefix. Nothing is copied between the two homes. Everything
the second task has, it got from the bucket.

The bucket is a dict behind two separate adapters, and that shape is the subject. The
sidecar puts objects through the object-store interface; the front gets one through the
reader interface. Neither can see the other's keys, so a key either matches or the fetch
misses, exactly as it would against S3.
