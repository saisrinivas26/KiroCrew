"""A runtime death is a process event: classified once, read by every tenant.

Field motivation, and every number here is measured rather than supposed. One
gateway lost a shared runtime carrying 15 sessions, 8 of them mid-prompt, and each
of the eight recorded the loss as its OWN failure -- charging its own retry
budget, marching its own circuit breaker, advancing its own auto-pause counter. A
second such death three hours later disturbed 10 more. Across that window every
sampled death carried ``rc=-15``, an ordinary SIGTERM teardown, while the ``HTTP
404`` registration line pasted onto the cards as the death REASON appears in 3 of
41 deaths and once on a runtime that does not die at all.

So two things are pinned here:

* the death is announced ONCE, where it is detected, with what the process was
  carrying at that instant -- and each consumer reads that one record instead of
  forming its own account (:mod:`kiro_crew.runtime_death`);
* the reason names the exit status, and a stderr line becomes the stated CAUSE
  only when it matches a signature that describes a death.

Single-tenant runtimes -- every runtime at ``CHAT_RUNTIME_CAP`` 1 with no
sub-agent on it -- are asserted UNCHANGED throughout, because that is the
behaviour-preservation bar this refactor carries.

    A shared-death streak stands in for a real counter -- a slot's recovery
    budget, a session's consecutive failures, a job's auto-pause count -- and it
    only works if it shares that counter's whole lifecycle. Two opposite failures
    come from getting this wrong, and both shipped once:

    * a key that is FRESHER than the counter (a non-persistent cron's
      ``cron:{id}:{uuid}``) never accumulates, so the bound never fires and the

    * a key never CLEARED on success accumulates for the process's life, so the
      bound is permanently tripped, the exemption silently stops applying, and the
      log reports a lifetime total as a consecutive one.

    So: any file that counts a streak must also clear one on a path that is NOT
    the hand-over. That exclusion is the whole strength of this check. A
    hand-over clears the streak too -- it has to, or the transfer is spent twice
    (see ``test_a_hand_over_forgets_the_streak_it_transferred``) -- so a test that
    merely asks whether the file mentions ``clear_shared_deaths`` is satisfied by
    the hand-over's clear alone, and deleting the success clear leaves it green.
    That is not hypothetical: adding the hand-over clears silenced this very test,

    Property 2 of the substitute-bound invariant, at the one place three earlier
    passes never looked. Property 2 was read as "cleared on success", and each
    site does clear on success -- but a hand-over is not a success, it is a
    TRANSFER, and after it both the streak and the real counter hold the same
    debt. The streak is then spent twice:

    * cron hands its streak to ``job.consecutive_failures`` and the job is paused,
      so no successful run can ever clear the streak. The operator resumes,
      ``_enable_job_locked`` zeroes ``consecutive_failures`` precisely so one more

      threshold, hands over again on the very next shared death. The job pauses
      after ONE failure while the alert prints the threshold.

      threshold forever, so every later shared death resets again: the exemption
      stops applying and the behaviour is the unexempted one, reached through the
      exemption's own bookkeeping.
