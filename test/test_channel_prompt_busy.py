"""A prompt-busy channel session is replaced, not papered over with a card.

When the ACP backend still holds an in-flight prompt it rejects every later
prompt on that session with ``already in progress``. Answering that with a
generic ``An error occurred`` card and returning without touching the session
leaves the wedge in place: the agent then rejects every subsequent @mention
identically, and the only recovery is a manual per-agent clear-context.

``AcpPromptBusy``'s own contract is that callers reset the session so the next
message cold-starts. The dashboard (``chat_runner``) and Slack (``handler``)
paths honour it, and this file pins the channel loop onto the same contract.

Bounded failure matters as much as the recovery: if the wedge survives the
reset the agent is reported ONCE and stops consuming its inbox, and the
abandoned replacement session is torn back down -- ``channel:``-keyed sessions
are exempt from both session reapers, and ``api_channel_wake_agent`` would
otherwise re-acquire the same wedged session out of the registry.
