"""Tests for the app-backend startup stale-reap (pidfile + PID-reuse-safe kill).

These pin the safety contract of ``_reap_stale_app_backends``: it terminates a
recorded app-backend pid ONLY when the pid is alive AND its start_time POSITIVELY
matches what was recorded at spawn (so a recycled pid, an unreadable start_time,
or a pid owned by another uid is never killed). Entries it cannot confirm-and-kill
but that are still alive are KEPT for a later attempt; handled entries are dropped.
