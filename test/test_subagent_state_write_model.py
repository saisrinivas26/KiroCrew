"""``state.json`` stays a WHOLE-FILE rewrite, and this gate is that policy's teeth.

THE POLICY. ``state.json`` is a run's artifact and evidence record, not a
coordination primitive. Scheduling's source of truth is the durable task queue,
which carries its own generation fencing. So the write model for ``state.json``
stays the whole-file rewrite it already is: no revision counter, no
compare-and-swap retry loop, no per-field or append-merge format. A second
coordination protocol one layer below the one that already exists buys ordering
this file does not need, and costs a format every reader must agree on -- the
state reader, the tombstone pruner, the keep scan, orphan recovery and the
legacy-record migration.

WHAT KEEPS THE WHOLE-FILE REWRITE SAFE. One invariant:

    Every whole-file ``state.json`` write happens at a KNOWN site, and each site
    that can run on the event loop carries its own fence.

The rewrite is a read, then a blocking fsync-and-rename, then nothing -- so two
writers on one agent interleave, and the later one restores a snapshot that
predates the other's write. Losing the other writer's fields is the visible
half; rolling back fields NEITHER writer touched is the damaging half. Off-loop
callers are serialized by the per-agent lock, which closes the class for them.
On the loop that lock cannot be waited on, because parking the gateway's only
loop behind a pool thread's fsync is the blocking-call class the repo forbids.
So an on-loop site carries its own fence instead, and a new site with none is
the defect this gate refuses to let land.

THE ASYMMETRY CLOSES BY MOVING WRITERS OFF THE LOOP, not by changing the file
format. A writer that leaves the loop needs no fence of its own: it inherits the
lock. That is the direction of travel, which is why the census below should
shrink and never grow.

WHY THE CENSUS IS THE SITES AND NOT "IS IT ON THE LOOP". Every write site today
sits in a synchronous function that a coroutine calls, so no amount of
``async def`` inspection can see it: asking "is this on the loop" is not
statically answerable, while "is this a write site" is exactly answerable. So
rule one pins the site set with its per-site call count, and a new write
anywhere fails -- forcing its author to say which fence it carries and whether
it runs on the loop. Rule two is the sharper case that IS statically decidable:
a write sitting DIRECTLY in a coroutine body. There are none, and that is a
measurement, not a wish, so rule two has no allowlist at all.

SCOPE BOUNDARY. ``asyncio.to_thread(update_state, ...)`` passes the writer as a
bare Name rather than calling it, so the sanctioned off-loop helper is not a site
here; that route has its own gate, which keeps every off-loop writer on the
drained helper. ``write_finished_result`` is the one other worker that route
hands a writer to (as ``state_writer``), so its merge is listed below and a
direct call to it from a coroutine is caught like any other write.

ONE RECORDING PLACE. An exception is recorded in the census and nowhere else, so
the fence and the site sit together where the policy lives. The detector matches a
writer by NAME, so an unrelated object carrying a same-named method reads as a
site; the remedy there is to rename that symbol or record it, not to add a second
way of spelling an exception.
