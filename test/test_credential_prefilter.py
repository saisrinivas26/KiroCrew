"""Differential test pinning `redact_credentials` output across the fast-path rewrite.

`redact_credentials` is the redaction boundary: a regression here writes live
credentials into persisted chat history. The optimisation it guards is pure
control flow — a pre-filter that skips a scan already known to be empty, one
shared base64 scan feeding two passes, a chunk decode that does not re-scan
its own input, and a bisect-backed span subtraction. None of it may change
output, so this module pins a plain, unoptimised three-pass implementation as
a reference oracle and asserts the live function is byte-identical to it, on
both the returned text AND the warnings.

The oracle deliberately reuses the module's own compiled patterns and gate
helpers, so what it isolates is exactly the control-flow change. Pattern edits
are covered instead by `test_every_pattern_branch_has_a_prefilter_anchor`, which
fails when a branch is added without a matching pre-filter anchor.

    Pass 1 is the one place this oracle follows the live redactor: ``sub()``
