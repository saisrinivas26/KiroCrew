"""Every mount in the namespace launcher refuses to exec when it fails.

Each ``mount(2)`` in the launcher IS a security control: three hide credential
paths, one pins mount propagation so the hiding cannot escape, and a pair exposes
the governance cache read-only (bind, then remount MS_RDONLY -- the remount is
what withholds the write, since MS_RDONLY is ignored on the initial bind).
Discarding the return value made them all fail OPEN -- the path stayed visible, or
stayed WRITABLE, and the agent ran anyway -- and nothing downstream noticed, because there is no post-mount
emptiness check, the launcher has no logger, and the pre-exec hardlink scan only
fires when a credential happens to carry an extra link.

These tests run the mount region lifted VERBATIM out of the shipped launcher, so
they cannot drift away from what actually executes in the child. ``_libc`` is a
stand-in whose ``mount`` returns a chosen rc, which is the only way to exercise
the failure path at all: this test process cannot create a user namespace (a
nested ``unshare`` is seccomp-denied inside an agent sandbox), and even outside
one a real EPERM would need an LSM mount rule the test cannot install.

Every behavioural assertion below has its own break-arm in
``test_break_arms_falsify_each_assertion``: a mutation applied to the shipped
source, chosen to move that assertion's own value. One arm for the whole file
would be inert for any assertion whose expected value happens to coincide with
the mutant's output.
