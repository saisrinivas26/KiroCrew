"""Differential + complexity guards for the two ``security.py`` linearity fixes.

Both fixes are performance-only and MUST be behaviour-preserving, so the tests
here are written as *differentials*: the expected values were captured from the
implementation as it stood immediately BEFORE each change (origin/main
``760d8f570``) and are pinned as literals. A verdict or byte that moves in either
direction fails.

Covered:

* ``redact_credentials`` pass 1 was ``for m in
  _CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS.finditer(result): result = result.replace(...)``, which
  rebuilt the whole string per match (O(n^2) on credential-dense text). Pass 1
  walks ``_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS.finditer(text)`` exactly once and records each
  match as a span; the string is spliced a single time after every pass. The
  redacted text AND the ``warnings`` list (content *and* order) must be
  unchanged.
* The sensitive-path regex anchor rewrite. That regex is gone (the
  shell gate does not match paths in command text; the OS sandbox and
  ``is_sensitive_path`` hold the fence), so what remains of the differential is
  the ``is_sensitive_path`` half, which pins that the path gate's verdicts did
  not move.
