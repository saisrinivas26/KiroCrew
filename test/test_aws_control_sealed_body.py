"""Tests for the non-dumpable sealing helper (:mod:`sealed_body`).

The helper exists to close GPT 5.6's finding that a WRITABLE memfd is reachable
through the gateway's dumpable ``/proc/<pid>/fd`` before it is sealed. The structural
guarantee is: the gateway never holds a writable alias of the body -- a forked child
clears its dumpable flag, creates+fills+seals the memfd and returns ONLY the sealed
descriptor. These tests pin the three observable consequences:

1. a sealed descriptor (and only that) reaches the caller;
2. a write to the returned descriptor is refused (``EPERM``);
3. a helper that dies before sealing yields no body -- the caller fails closed.
