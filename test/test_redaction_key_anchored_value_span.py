"""Key-anchored credential branches redact the value, never the key that names it.

Four branches of ``_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS`` begin at the KEY naming a secret --
``aws_secret_access_key = <v>``, ``SessionToken: <v>``, ``AccessKeyId=<v>`` and
``Authorization: Bearer <v>``. A whole-match replacement there takes the key,
the ``:``/``=`` separator and the opening quote along with the value, so a JSON
pair collapses to one bare string (``{"Authorization": "Bearer t"}`` reads back as
``{"[REDACTED: credential]"}``) and a file viewer reports a file that is valid on
disk as invalid JSON.

Each key-anchored branch therefore carries its value as ONE named capturing
group and ``_credential_value_span`` redacts that group alone -- one rule for
every branch. This file pins the rule by document shape (JSON, header line,
INI / ``.env`` line) for every key-anchored branch, and pins the STRUCTURE of the
alternation so the next branch cannot regress it in either direction: a
key-anchored branch without a value group collapses the pair again, and a
capturing group on a whole-match branch narrows its span and leaks the rest of
the token.

Every fixture value is synthetic (``…-not-a-secret-…``) and has no real
provider-key shape, so the secret scanners that read test files stay quiet.

# ── Presence-only readers of the patterns ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# Several gates never redact: they ask whether text CARRIES a credential and
# refuse when it does -- the ledger push gate over `ledger.jsonl`, the deploy
# and preview file scans, the exfil request gates. Each read the raw patterns
# (`get_credential_patterns().search`, `_contains_fixed_credential`, the hard
# URL regex). Once the key survives redaction, the redactor's own output
# `key=[REDACTED: credential]` matches a key-anchored branch again, so a
# presence-only reader called cleaned text live: the ledger refused every push
# from its first redacted entry on. The readers now go through
# `contains_credential` / `credential_matches`, which apply pass 1's own rule
# for a tag standing as the value, and the hard regex declines that value by
# construction. These pins hold the two sides together: whatever the redactor
# leaves alone in silence is clean to every presence-only reader, and whatever
# it claims or warns on is live to every one of them.
