    A never-activated (default) install is not gated at all, so it must return

    credentialed ``git ls-remote --symref`` probe against it. Before the fix the route
    resolved the destination and ran the probe FIRST and only then bailed as ``not_activated``,
    so every default install did credentialed remote work against a destination read from
    agent-writable worktree config.

    Mutation check: ``_effective_push_target`` and ``_run_git`` are stubbed to RAISE if called.
