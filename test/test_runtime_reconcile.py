"""Behaviour of the two-way runtime reconciler and of the lease gate on every sweep.

Two rules are under test, and they are opposites of each other.

The reconciler must ACT on a disagreement between the kernel and this gateway's
records, because a disagreement nobody resolves is a process that survives every
sweep and every restart. It must also be extremely reluctant to act in the one
direction that ends a process, because absence from a record is evidence that
something is unclaimed and not evidence that it is abandoned -- the unowned
population on a healthy host is mostly processes with good owners that no
*session* record describes.

The sweeps must REFUSE to signal a pid a session still holds a lease on. Each of
them already carries a shield, and the shield is a set gathered before the
candidate scan and an event-loop hop before the signal; the gate is asked about
one pid at the decision point, which is the only place the answer cannot already
be stale.

Every guard added by this change is named here with the test that goes red when
it is removed, so a later reader can verify the guard still earns its place:

* the spawn-marker condition -> ``test_a_process_without_our_marker_is_never_killed``
* the two-pass confirmation -> ``test_one_pass_only_counts_an_unowned_process``
* the age floor -> ``test_a_process_younger_than_the_floor_is_never_killed``
* the last-moment gate -> ``test_the_gate_still_refuses_after_every_other_condition``
* the kill budget -> ``test_one_pass_spends_a_bounded_number_of_kills``
* the unreadable-registry refusal -> ``test_an_unreadable_registry_refuses_the_whole_pass``
* the unsignalable-pid rule -> ``test_an_unsignalable_pid_is_not_a_dead_one``
* the recycle check -> ``test_a_record_whose_pid_now_names_a_stranger_counts_as_dead``
* its fail-closed answer -> ``test_an_unreadable_identity_is_not_a_stranger``
* the periodic pid sweep's gate -> ``test_the_periodic_pid_sweep_withholds_a_leased_pid``
* the untracked-MCP sweep's gate -> ``test_the_untracked_mcp_sweep_withholds_a_leased_pid``
* the scope reaper's gate -> ``test_the_scope_reaper_does_not_signal_a_leased_pid``
* the orphan reconcile's gate -> ``test_the_orphan_reconcile_withholds_a_leased_pid``
* the reset ladder's gate -> ``test_the_reset_ladder_withholds_the_kill_and_the_shared_child_sweep``
* the cron reaper's gate -> ``test_the_cron_reaper_reports_a_leased_runtime_instead_of_killing_it``

A finished-result signal sits beside the reconciler, because the direction that
PROTECTS a result is the opposite of the direction that ends a process. A run
records ``result_complete`` only after it rewrote ``result.txt`` whole, so the
flag is the one completeness fact (``result_is_whole``), and the reconcile must
neither demote a flagged answer to a fragment nor promote an unflagged one:

* the completeness rule -> ``test_a_flagged_result_is_the_agents_answer``
* its safe-direction complement -> ``test_an_unflagged_result_still_under_claims_as_a_fragment``
* end to end over the reconcile -> ``test_the_reconcile_announces_a_finished_run_as_finished``

Every one of those pairings is executed, not asserted in prose: the harness named
in the pull request re-applies each mutation and requires the named test to fail.

Three positive controls sit beside them, because a refusal test passes for free
when the thing it refuses never happens: the spawn-marker read against a fixture
process table, the recycle seam against a registry file in the product's own
format, and the lease seam against the real ownership table.
