"""A triggered skill's body is injected at most once per provider session.

With ``skills.max_triggered`` above 0, a matched skill's full body is injected
at most once per provider session: the first match sends the body, and a later
match in the same session sends the cheap pointer line ``inject_on_trigger:
false`` skills already use. A monitor loop that re-sends the same message
therefore does not re-send the same 8k–34k-char body every cycle — the copies
would add nothing, because the provider replays native history.

The record fails SAFE: whenever it is reset — a fresh session, the first turn
after a compaction, an agent switch, an edited skill body, or simply no
session key at all — the body re-injects rather than falling silent. Every test
here fails if a reset stops re-injecting, or if a repeat stops being demoted.
