"""DeepSeek Harness as an ACP backend: the decisions that must not drift.

The harness is a plugin host and ACP is one of the profiles it boots, so most of
what this file pins is ordinary onboarding vocabulary. Three things are not:

* it serves ``session/resume`` and REJECTS ``session/load``, so the shared restore
  path has to pick both the capability it reads and the verb it sends from one
  membership set;
* its gate plugin turns each tool decision into an ACP permission request, and a
  bounded no-follow load-marker read verifies that routing before it is offered;
* it advertises reasoning effort under its own option id, so the id is read from a
  table rather than spelled at each site.
